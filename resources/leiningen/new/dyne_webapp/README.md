## Getting Started

FIXME

### Prerequisites

<img class="pull-left" src="https://secrets.dyne.org/static/img/leiningen.jpg"
style="padding-right: 1.5em">

Please install
1. A JDK. The software is tested on [openJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) versions 7 and 8 as well as with [oracleJDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and 10. Make sure that the env var JAVA_HOME is set to the JDK install dir like [mentioned here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/index.html).
2. [MongoDB community edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). The software has been tested on Mongo v3.6.4. Earlier versions might not work due to loss of precision (Decimal128 was not introduced).
3. [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) which is used for dependency management like:
```
mkdir ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -O ~/bin/lein
chmod +x ~/bin/lein
```

### Running 

First of all check the configuration in
`resources/{{name}}.yaml` and adjust its contents to your
setup. Here a sample configuration:

FIXME

Once correctly configured, from inside the social-wallet-api source
directory one can use various commands to run it live (refreshing live
changes to the code) using:

- `lein ring server` (which will start and spawn a browser on it)
- `lein ring server-headless` (will start without browser)

One can also use `lein uberjar` to build a standalone jar application,
or `lein uberwar` to build a standalone war application ready to be
served from enterprise infrastructure using JBoss or Tomcat.

## Running the tests

To run all tests one need to run
` lein midje`
on the project dir
